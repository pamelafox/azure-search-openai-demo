Staying in-network helps members get the most out of their coverage and saves them money, as in-network providers typically charge lower rates [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=15].\n\nOverall, using in-network providers results in lower coinsurance rates compared to out-of-network providers.", "context": "Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=13:  Coinsurance IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. Forexample, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%. Under Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally, coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%. It's important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan's copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services. When you receive services, it's important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=15:  Second, it's important to stay in-network as much as possible. Staying in-network helps members get the most out of their coverage and saves them money. In-network providers typically charge lower rates and provide a higher level of care than out-of-network providers. Third, it's important to understand the difference between deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. Deductibles are the amount a member has to pay before the plan starts paying, copays are a set fee for services, and coinsurance is the percentage of the cost a member has to pay. Understanding these three terms can help members make more informed decisions about their care. Finally, it's important to take advantage of preventive care services. Preventive care services are covered at 100% by Northwind Health Plus and can help members stay healthy and avoid costly treatments and services down the road. Reaching the out-of-pocket maximum can be a challenge, but with the right knowledge and tips, members can take advantage of their Northwind Health Plus plan and get the most out of their coverage.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=14:  Many plans offer lower coinsurance rates for in-network providers, meaning you will pay less for the same service. 3. Ask your provider for an estimate of the cost of a service before you receive it. This will help you determine how much of the cost you will be responsible for. 4. Keep track of the services you receive and the amount you pay. This will help you understand how much you have paid towards your coinsurance requirement for the year. 5. Contact your plan administrator if you have any questions about your coinsurance requirement or what services are subject to coinsurance.
