Review your plan documents to understand the coinsurance rates for all services you may need.

In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=103: Provider: An in-network provider is a healthcare provider that has a contract with Northwind Health and is included in the network of providers who are eligible to receive payments from Northwind Health.
