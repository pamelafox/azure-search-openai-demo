In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=103: Provider: An in-network provider is a healthcare provider that has a contract with Northwind Health and is included in the network of providers who are eligible to receive payments from Northwind Health.
