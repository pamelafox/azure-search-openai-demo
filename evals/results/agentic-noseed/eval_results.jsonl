Generally:\n\n1. **Primary vs. Secondary Coverage**: Medicare or Medicaid usually pays first as the primary plan, followed by Northwind Standard as the secondary plan. However, there are exceptions where Northwind Standard may pay first, such as in cases involving employer-sponsored plans or specific legal requirements [Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=75][Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=73].\n\n2. **Medicare Part D**: For prescription drugs, Northwind Standard is the primary payer, and Medicare Part D is secondary [Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=74].\n\n3. **Proof of Coverage**: You must provide evidence of other coverage to ensure proper COB.

Coordinating benefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination helps to ensure that you don't pay more than you should for your health care. When coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the first plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays second is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its allowed amount for the services you received. The secondary plan then pays the difference between what the primary plan paid and the total cost of the services. The way in which you coordinate benefits will depend on the type of coverage you have. Coordinating Benefits with Medicare If you have Medicare, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age and older, people with certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=75:  Coordination of Benefits Exceptions There are a few exceptions to COB rules that may apply to you. If you are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or a veterans' health plan, Northwind Standard may pay first, even if the other plan is usually the primary payer. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a plan that is required by law to coordinate benefits, such as an employer-sponsored plan, Northwind Standard may pay first. Understanding How COB Affects Your Benefits When COB applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible expenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost. Depending on the type of service, the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses. When this happens, the secondary payer may pay nothing.For example, if you receive a medical bill for $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the secondary payer will pay the remaining balance of $200. However, if the primary payer pays the full $1,000, the secondary payer will not pay anything.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=72:  WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans It may be possible to coordinate benefits with other health care plans if you have other coverage. Coordinating benefits allows you to receive payments from each health plan towards covered services, as long as the total amount of payments does not exceed the total charges for the service. If you have other coverage, such as Medicare or an employer-sponsored health plan, the Northwind Standard plan may be able to coordinate benefits with those plans. This can help reduce your out-of-pocket costs for health care services. How Do I Coordinate Benefits with Other Plans?If you have other health care coverage, you should contact the other health care plan(s) to determine how to coordinate benefits. Depending on the plans you have, you may be able to coordinate benefits by filing a claim with both plans. You will need to provide the other plan with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the Northwind Health plan.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=3:  This means that you will need to pay the first $2,000 of your medical expenses before the plan will begin to cover the remaining amount.

For Northwind Standard, the co-payment is $30 for primary care visits and $50 for specialist visits. The co-insurance is 20% of the remaining cost after the deductible has been met. Out-of-Pocket Maximum The out-of-pocket maximum for Northwind Standard is $6,000 per person, per year.

Subrogation And Reimbursement Subrogation And Reimbursement When you have other health coverage, such as Medicare or another employer's health plan, Northwind Standard may still provide coverage in certain circumstances. This is called \"subrogation and reimbursement.\" Subrogation and reimbursement works when another health plan pays for a service that is covered by Northwind Standard. In this case, Northwind Standard will pay for the same service, assuming that it was medically necessary and you received it from an in-network provider. If Northwind Standard pays for a service that is already covered by your other health plan, you may be responsible for reimbursing Northwind Standard. This can happen if you do not provide Northwind Standard with proof of your other coverage. There are certain exceptions to subrogation and reimbursement. If you are a Medicare beneficiary, Northwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from Medicare. In addition, Northwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from any other health plan if the service you received is not covered by the other health \n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=80:  If you have more than one health insurance policy, you may need to provide proof of the other coverage, such as an insurance card or a letter from the other insurer, to verify which plan is primary and which is secondary.

If you are covered by a spouse's health plan, the primary plan is usually the plan that covers the spouse and the secondary plan is usually the plan that covers you. Additionally, if you are covered by more than one group plan, the primary plan is usually the plan of the employer who has the most employees.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=76:  Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age and older, people with certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

If you have Medicare, you will need to use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network to coordinate benefits with your Medicare coverage. Medicare will pay first and then Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance. Coordinating Benefits with Other Employer Plans If you are covered under a health plan from another employer, that plan is usually considered the primary payer and Northwind Health Plus is considered the secondary payer. Your other employer plan will pay first and then Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance after the other employer plan has paid its portion.To coordinate benefits with your other employer plan, you must use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=95:  This could include coverage from your spouse's or a parent's employer, or from a government-sponsored program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If you and your spouse have coverage under different plans, you must determine which plan is the primary plan and which is secondary. This is important, as the primary plan will pay first; the secondary plan will pay what the primary plan does not. If you have other coverage, you must notify Northwind Health of any changes in your coverage status or any changes in any of your other coverage. If you fail to do so, you may be responsible for any charges that Northwind Health would have paid if you had notified them of the other coverage. In certain circumstances, you may be able to keep your other coverage and still be eligible for coverage under the Northwind Standard plan. However, if the other coverage is primary, you will be responsible for any charges that would have been paid by the Northwind Standard plan. It is also important to note that if you have coverage through a government-sponsored program such as Medicare or Medicaid, you may be subject to certain restrictions.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=74:  Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expensesthat exceed the limits of the primary plan. For example, if the primary plan has a $1,000 deductible and Northwind Standard has a $500 deductible, only the $500 deductible from the primary plan will be paid. There are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules. For instance, if you have Medicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind Standard will be the secondary coverage. However, if you have Medicare Part D for prescription drugs, Northwind Standard will be the primary coverage and Medicare Part D will be the secondary coverage. It's also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to provide evidence of that coverage to your health plan. This is known as \"creditable coverage,\" and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses once the primary plan has paid.

It's also important to be aware of the coinsurance rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it's worth the cost to pay more for out-of- network services. It's also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the actual cost. If you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment.

This will help you budget for any services you may need in the future and be better prepared for the cost. 2. Consider using in-network providers when possible.

It is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-networkservices.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8: Or Non-Contracted Providers HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers One of the important considerations when choosing a health insurance plan is understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers. When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs. Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs. In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=45:  With Northwind Standard, you can take advantage of these important services, which are covered at no additional cost.Remember, preventive care is an important part of your overall health. Northwind Health is dedicated to helping you get the preventive care you need to stay healthy and protect yourself for the future. Professional Visits And Services COVERED SERVICES: Professional Visits and Services Northwind Standard provides coverage for professional visits and services. This includes visits to your primary care physician, specialists, and other health care providers. This coverage is available for services that are medically necessary and are provided by in- network providers. In-network providers will generally provide services at a lower cost than out-of-network providers, so it is important to check with Northwind Health before making an appointment to ensure that the provider is in-network. This can help you save money and avoid unexpected costs. The Northwind Standard plan covers services such as: - Preventive care services, including physicals, immunizations, and screenings - Diagnostic \n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=16:  Premiums are typically deducted from payroll on a pre-determined schedule. If a payment is missed, the employee may be subject to a late fee or other penalties. Out-of-Pocket Costs Employees will be responsible for a variety of out-of-pocket costs associated with their Northwind Standard plan. These costs can include copays, coinsurance, and deductibles.Copays are fixed amounts that are due at the time of each visit. Coinsurance is a percentage of the total cost of a service that is paid by the employee. Deductibles are a fixed amount that must be paid by the employee before the insurance company begins covering the costs of services. It's important for employees to understand what their out-of-pocket costs will be for each type of service to ensure that they are prepared to pay their portion of the bill. Network Providers Northwind Standard allows employees to choose from a variety of in-network providers. These include primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. It's important for employees to make sure that they are seeing providers that are in-network to maximize their coverage.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8:  Generally, out-of-network providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted providers, so the cost of care could be significantly higher. It is also important to know that services received from an out-of-network provider may not count towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you may be responsible for paying the entire cost of the services, minus any applicable discounts. It is important to keep in mind that you may also be subject to balance billing from an out-of-network provider. Balance billing occurs when the provider bills you for the difference between their billed charges and the amount paid by Northwind Health Plus. In some cases, you may be able to receive care from an out-of-network provider if there is not an in-network option available. In these cases, Northwind Health Plus will cover the same amount as if the care was provided by an in-network provider. When considering care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to understand the potential risks of doing so.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=45: vaccinations 路 Health screenings and tests, such as blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes tests 路 Counseling, such as lifestyle and nutrition counseling 路 Immunizations 路 Vision and hearing screenings 路 Other preventive services as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Please note that Northwind Standard does not cover all preventive care services.

Staying in-network helps members get the most out of their coverage and saves them money. In-network providers typically charge lower rates and provide a higher level of care than out-of-network providers. Third, it's important to understand the difference between deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. Deductibles are the amount a member has to pay before the plan starts paying, copays are a set fee for services, and coinsurance is the percentage of the cost a member has to pay. Understanding these three terms can help members make more informed decisions about their care. Finally, it's important to take advantage of preventive care services. Preventive care services are covered at 100% by Northwind Health Plus and can help members stay healthy and avoid costly treatments and services down the road.
