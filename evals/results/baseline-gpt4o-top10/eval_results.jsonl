Second, use caution when selecting providers. The Northwind Standard plan has a large network of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are not paying more than you have to for services. Third, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical costs. Finally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket. By following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan. Coinsurance IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=14:  When you receive services, it's important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs. It's also important to be aware of the coinsurance rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it's worth the cost to pay more for out-of- network services. It's also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the actual cost. If you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment. Finally, it's important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-of- pocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket for services.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=35:  It's important to note that some services, such as cosmetic procedures, are not covered by Northwind Health Plus.

If it's out-of-network, you'll be responsible for a portion of the costs. · Ask your doctor or hospital staff about any potential copayments or coinsurance costs you'll be responsible for before receiving any services. This will help you budget accordingly. · If you're admitted to the hospital, make sure you understand the services you'll be receiving and verify that they're covered by your plan. · Ask the hospital staff if they've taken all the necessary steps to ensure that all the services you're receiving are covered by your plan.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=15:  Second, it's important to stay in-network as much as possible.

Understanding these three terms can help members make more informed decisions about their care. Finally, it's important to take advantage of preventive care services. Preventive care services are covered at 100% by Northwind Health Plus and can help members stay healthy and avoid costly treatments and services down the road.

When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs. Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs. In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=7:  You can find a list of in-network providers on the Northwind Health website. What if I visit an out-of-network provider? Visiting an out-of-network provider means that you are not protected from balance billing. Out-of-network providers may charge more for the same services than in-network providers, and you may be responsible for the difference between what they charge and what your insurance company is willing to pay. It is important to check if a provider is in- network before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs. Tips to avoid balance billing: · Always check if a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.· Ask your provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan before you receive any services. · Double-check that the providers you visit are in-network. · Ask for an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs ahead of time. .

Exceptions to the balance billing protection: · Balance billing protection does not apply to emergency services.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8:  Generally, out-of-network providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted providers, so the cost of care could be significantly higher. It is also important to know that services received from an out-of-network provider may not count towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you may be responsible for paying the entire cost of the services, minus any applicable discounts. It is important to keep in mind that you may also be subject to balance billing from an out-of-network provider. Balance billing occurs when the provider bills you for the difference between their billed charges and the amount paid by Northwind Health Plus. In some cases, you may be able to receive care from an out-of-network provider if there is not an in-network option available. In these cases, Northwind Health Plus will cover the same amount as if the care was provided by an in-network provider. When considering care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to understand the potential risks of doing so.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=27:  If you receive services from an out-of-network provider, you may also be responsible for paying the difference between the amount billed by the provider and the amount the plan will pay.
